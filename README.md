I have worked on three datasets namely: 
1) Cifar-10 dataset
2) Dogs vs Cats datset
3) Mnsit dataset

and after preprocessig the image data, have applied classification algorithms such as decision tree,random forest,CNN on the datasets.
Though i tried to apply quantum algorithms for classification like QSVM,QNN too but after some point it became too complicated and hence i srapped all that and focussed on classical algorithms only.
